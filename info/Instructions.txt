Currently we are monitoring messages posted in the top ~500 public Telegram groups for cryptocurrencies.
We have several months of data and are looking to understand more of the patterns of usage and activity within each group.
Each group ranges from 1000 to up to 100k members though like with most communities, majority are often inactive. 

I would like to start with discovering the following insights for 30-day and 7-day time periods.
This will be information for each channel:

1. How many unique posters are there
2. How many people post daily 
3. Number of total messages
4. Estimated percentage of questions (message containing “?”)
5. Distribution of total messages by top posters
